Recently, in a small minority of situations (less than 1% of iPad Pro users), we have received some reports that the tablift left small indentations on the back of the iPad. This did not affect functionality, but it did leave small marks. In order to prevent this from happening, we suggest that you use a slim hard case while using your iPad Pro with the tablift. This will prevent any marks from being made. With over 250,000 Tablifts sold, we have had ZERO reports of this issue with any other iPad or any other tablet brand or model.
